# mps-UMLRT
Implementation of a subset of the MARTE (UML-RT) UML language profile

The MPS project is migrated to MPS 2022.2.

See license subdirectory for the various components used and their licenses.

The starting point of this language and at least some importers is in part thanks to Dmitrii Nikeshkin's work on [Domain-extensible model-driven embedded software development IDE](https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/118101905/2018_10_24_ST_Dmitrii_Nikeshkin.pdf)
